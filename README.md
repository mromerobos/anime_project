## Relevant information

Here I'll post some information sources and owners of the content.

### Api used

**Jikan API** UNOFFICIAL MYANIMELIST API

Jikan (時間) is an open-source PHP & REST API for the “most active online anime + manga community and database” — MyAnimeList.net. It parses the website to satisfy the need for an API.

- [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/)

I used this API because doesn't need authentication.
Other APIs I was interested have authentication methods with short periods of availability, so i decided to use an easy access one.

The problem is that has strict requirements to use:
- Daily Limit: Unlimited
- **30 requests** / minute
- **2 requests** / second


### Icons and Image source:

Some of the icons and images I used are from this websites.
- [Source 1 of icons/images](https://icons8.com/)
- [Source 2 of icons/images](http://www.freepik.com/)

### Serialization of objects

I used following documentation to serialize the http responses:
- [JSON and serialization](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/json)

### Url Launcher

I used this plugin to lauch an url and navigate to oficial page of the resources I'm working with.
